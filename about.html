        <h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi! Thanks for coming on my page! Here you will find more information about me.</p>
<p>I'm Lucas, a 29 years old engineer. Below you will find my professional career. I've try to write it in a more digestible way than on a banal curriculum vitae.</p>
<p>Thank you if you read those lines! If you have any question, please ask me at: <a href="mailto:gicquelucas.pro@gmail.com">gicquelucas.pro@gmail.com</a></p>

<h2>Career</h2>
<h3>Technician</h3>
<p>
    After doing some kind of terrible graduate degree, I have worked for <a href="https://www.edokial.com/">Edokial</a>
    for a year and a half as a technician.
</p>
<p>
    This experience allows me to deal directly with clients, impose deadlines, saying no (most important!)
    and organize myself in a project involving several people.
</p>
<p>
    Working on specific publishing softwares and back-end applications, I surprisingly surpassed myself and therefore wanted to continue my studies...
</p>

<h3>Engineer in training</h3>
<p>
    I continued my studies in an engineering school on a work-study basis.
    Every two months, I alternated between school <a href="https://www.3il-ingenieurs.fr/ingenieur-du-numerique/programme-grande-ecole-dingenieur-3il/ingenieur-3il-en-alternance/">
    3il Rodez
</a> (studying network, programming, mathematics, etc.) and, again, <a href="https://www.edokial.com/">Edokial</a> (working on client/server projects, object-oriented applications, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    The last year of school was special, because thanks to good grades, I went to Québec in <a href="https://www.uqac.ca/">UQAC</a>
    for 4 months and came back 8 months in Edokial for a big project:
</p>
<p>
    In order to facilitate the decision-making process of the director of printing and enveloping at Edokial, I created with him 
    a Business Intelligence tool retrieving all the data of his production in order to make a personalized summary in real time.
    He was very glad of my work and I got easily graduated also thanks to him.
</p>

<h3>Engineer</h3>
<p>
    After graduating as an engineer, I continued to work at Edokial thanks to a partnership with 
    <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/">ISAE Supaéro</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I worked with a lecturer on blockchain, and more particularly on cryptographic protocols (such as proof of storage),
    in order to:
    <ul>
        <li>Firstly, train myself on blockchain for Edokial</li>
        <li>And secondly, on the other hand, to carry out research work for ISAE.</li>
    </ul>
    Once trained, I was able to lead blockchain-related projects independently at Edokial.
    This resulted in delivering three proofs of concept on various topics, including one involving a customer.
</p>

<h2>What about now?</h2>
<p>
    Now I'm going freelance so I can help build multiple blockchain-related projects in Europe.
</p>
<p>
    I am an expert in the back-end part in Solidity, C++, C#, Java, Python,
    but I can get by on the front-end on JavaScript, React, NodeJS.
</p>
<p>
    When I don't work for companies, I work on my projects on Github, so stay tuned if you want to know what's coming!
</p>
<p>
    Thanks for reading, I wish you a nice day!
